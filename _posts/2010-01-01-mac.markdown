# macOS

On Mac the recommended approach is to use the official [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installer. Previously the package manager [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) was a great choice--it handled software installs and upgrades elegantly in _most_ cases--but for Python itself there are several serious issues detailed by [Justin Mayer in this post](https://justinmayer.com/posts/homebrew-python-is-not-for-you/). As a result, using the official [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installer is now a better option.

## Official Installer

Open a new browser window and visit the [Downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Click on the button for "Download Python 3.9.5" or whatever the latest version is.

Click "Allow" on the popup asking if you want to allow downloads from "www.python.org."

Open up a new `Finder` window (the keyboard shortcut of pressing `Command` + `n` will do this) and click on the sidebar for "Downloads." Then doubleclick on the Python package to install it.

This launches the Python Installer. Click on the "Continue" button.

Next up are several screens. Click "Continue" again on the _Read Me_ page.

Next is the _License_ page. Click "Continue" which will launch a pop up asking if you agree to the terms. Click on "Agree."

The standard install will save Python to your disk. Click on the "Install" button.

This will launch another pop-up asking for your password. Enter it and click "Install Software."

After installation is a Summary window. You can hit the "Close" button on this.

A popup will ask if you want to move the Python installer to the trash. Click on "Move to Trash" as we no longer need the installer.

There will also be a new Finder window opened with the Python 3.9 package.

## IDLE vs Command Line

The simplest way to use Python is via the built-in IDLE. Click on the link for IDLE which launches a new Shell. You can type any command here such as `print("Hello, World")`.

You can also now access Python from the command line. Open up the `Terminal` application which is located within `Applications` -> `Utilities` -> `Terminal`.

Once open, type `python3` to launch the Python interpreter from the command line. When you see the prompt `>>>` you know it is working. To confirm, type `print("Hello, World")` again.
