# Windows

Microsoft hosts a community release of Python 3 in the Microsoft Store for computers running Windows 10+, the latest version of the operating system. This is now the recommended way to install Python: it handles auto-updates, can be uninstalled easily, and does not update PATH variables in a way that breaks other applications.

## Python App in the Microsoft Store

Click on the search bar at the bottom left of the screen and type "python." Click on the best match result.

This automatically launches Python 3.9 on the Microsoft Store. Click on the blue "Get" button to download it.

__Note__: If you have a "See System Requirements" link below the Get button it's likely you need to upgrade to Windows 10. And if you're not logged into your Microsoft account, there will be a prompt asking if you want to sign in. It's fine to say "No, thanks" for now.

Once downloaded, click on the three dots `...` after "Pin to Start" and click on "Pin to Taskbar" so it is always available.

Click on the pinned Python logo on the bottom taskbar.

This opens up the Python IDLE. Try a simple `print("Hello, World")` command to confirm everything works:

It is also possible to access it via the command line. On Windows, type "PowerShell" in the Start Menu search bar in the lower left corner.

This opens up the Windows PowerShell terminal which has a dark blue background. Type `python --version` to confirm which version is installed and then the same `print("Hello, World")` command as before.

That's it! You're ready to go.
